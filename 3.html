<h3>Heading</h3>
<p>Since first being recorded late last year in China,
  the Covid-19 coronavirus has spread around the world,
  and been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.
  However, differences in testing mean that the number of cases may be
  understated for some countries.

<p style="margin-top:20px;">Obviously, larger countries tend to have higher numbers both of cases
  and of deaths. But there are many other factors in play,
  such as the demographic profiles of the countries; countries with
  ageing populations may be hit harder because the disease is more
  dangerous to older people.</p>
